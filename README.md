# Solving Traffic problems via Emergence - Study Project

>We are trying to use the knowledge of Complex Adaptive Systems to try and solve the problems of traffic via the phenomena of emergence.

###PROBLEMS TO TACKLE:
* untangling traffic congestions - every car has independent objectives(destinations) to go to but is fixed in a jam, local interactions using fixed rules must lead to an overall emergent behaviour where the congestion slowly dissolves (there are two sorts of cases we're taking)
* 
* decentralized decisive behaviors which enable choosing least crowded lanes leading to same destination
* phantom jams (unexpected jams which propogate like shock waves)

###KEY IDEAS AND CONCEPTS that could be used!
* Stigmergy
* self organization
* school of fish, flock of birds
